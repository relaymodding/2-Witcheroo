It is said that when a pillar of 3 %s on top of %s is lit ablaze, a %s will be created. That %s can then be used on a living creature. If they have a compatible soul, it'll be absorbed. You can then use your staff on an entity of a similar type near a cauldron to bind it to the body. You will however require mana to operate the staff, you can top your mana up by right clicking a %s block."
